## Cluster Setup

From a bare kubernetes cluster we wish to accomplish several things before we begin

See installation files to create a new cluster, once kubeconfig has the cluster context set to our cluster, proceed.

helm init
```
to prepare the cluster for installations via helm
NOTE: need to add tls verification later

## Monitor - Prometheus and Grafana
